										Serialization
										-------------
->It ia procees of converting java supported from to file/network supported form.
->Deserlization is procees of reading from file/network supported form to java supported from.
->Serlizable interface is interface which has no any method that why it called as marker interface.
->Methods which are called by JVM those methods are known as callback method.
->If Object class implements Serialized interface then no any class need to implement serializable, 
	but object doesn't implement serializable.
->All servlet class in java doesn't need to implement serializable ,because their parent class implements serializable.
->Work done in instance control flow :-
	1)Identificationn of instance variable.
	2)Execution of instance variable assignment and instance block.
	3)Execution of constructor.
->To serialize child class, there is not require to implements serialized in parent claas, if this is so then we cannot 
	serialize any class because object class which is parent of all class does not implements serialized interface.
->Every non-serialized parent class must have a no argument constructor.


										Externalization
										---------------
->It contain two method 1)writeExternal() 2)readExternal().
->It is a child interface of Serilization.
