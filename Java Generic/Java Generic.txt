--> The main objective of generics is to provide type safety and resolve type casting problem.

--> Arrays are type safe, We can give garantee for the type element inside array.
	if our program requiredmen is only string type then we can chosse string array. If we add any other type of value than
	compiler give error.

-->But coolections are not type safe. so that can not give garentee for type of element present in collection. In that case,
	while reteiving element from collection if there is a element which does not of expected type that it will give run time
	error.

-->Type casting :-
	--> While retriving element from collection it is required to perform type casting because element can be of any type.

-->For storing only string type data in arraylist we can use generic i.e: ArrayList<String> al = new ArrayList<string>
	if we try to store any other type data rhan it will give compile time error and type casting is not required while reading data.
